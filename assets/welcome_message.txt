Hello {user_first_name}! 👋

Welcome to the **Moments Bot** — your daily companion for capturing life's most meaningful moments!

📖 **Inspired by "Storyworthy" by Matthew Dicks**

This bot is based on the transformative exercise called **Homework for Life**, brilliantly described in Matthew Dicks' book "Storyworthy: Engage, Teach, Persuade, and Change Your Life Through the Power of Storytelling."

💡 **What is Homework for Life?**

As Matthew Dicks explains:
> "Homework for Life is designed to help you find stories in the every day of your life. It takes about five minutes a day."

The practice is beautifully simple:
> "At the end of every day, reflect upon your day and ask yourself one simple question: If I had to tell a story from today — a five-minute story onstage about something that took place over the course of this day — what would it be?"

Why does this matter?
> "When you start looking for story-worthy moments in your life, you start to see them everywhere... Homework for Life has a way of making every single day more meaningful."

🎯 **How This Bot Helps**

Each day, I'll remind you to capture your moment — that one story-worthy event that made today memorable. Over time, you'll build a treasure trove of memories and discover the extraordinary in your ordinary days.
