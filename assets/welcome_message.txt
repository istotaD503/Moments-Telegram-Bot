Hello {user_first_name}! 👋

Welcome to the <b>Moments Bot</b> - your daily companion for capturing life's most meaningful moments!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📖 <b>Inspired by "Storyworthy"</b>

This bot is based on the transformative exercise called <b>Homework for Life</b>, brilliantly described in Matthew Dicks' book "Storyworthy: Engage, Teach, Persuade, and Change Your Life Through the Power of Storytelling."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💡 <b>What is Homework for Life?</b>

As Matthew Dicks explains:

<i>"Homework for Life is designed to help you find stories in the every day of your life. It takes about five minutes a day."</i>

The practice is beautifully simple:

<i>"At the end of every day, reflect upon your day and ask yourself one simple question: If I had to tell a story from today - a five-minute story onstage about something that took place over the course of this day - what would it be?"</i>

Why does this matter?

<i>"When you start looking for story-worthy moments in your life, you start to see them everywhere... Homework for Life has a way of making every single day more meaningful."</i>

🎯 <b>How This Bot Helps</b>

Each day, I'll help you capture your moment - that one story-worthy event that made today memorable. Over time, you'll build a treasure trove of memories and discover the extraordinary in your ordinary days.
