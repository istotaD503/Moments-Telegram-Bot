# Spanish Moments Bot - Implementation Roadmap

## Project Overview
Transform the existing "Hello World" Telegram bot into a Spanish language learning tool that combines Matthew Dicks' "Homework for Life" concept with active language practice.

## Core Concept
1. **Daily Moment Capture**: Bot prompts user to write about story-worthy moments
2. **English â†’ Spanish Translation**: User writes in English, then attempts Spanish translation
3. **AI-Powered Feedback**: Bot provides corrections, explanations, and improvements
4. **Moment Storage**: All moments are saved for future review and progress tracking

### 1.2 Implement Conversation States
**Goal**: Create a multi-step conversation flow for moment capture

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Install `python-telegram-bot[job-queue]` for scheduling
- [ ] Implement ConversationHandler for multi-step dialogs
- [ ] Create conversation states:
  - `WAITING_FOR_MOMENT` - User writes moment in English
  - `WAITING_FOR_SPANISH` - User attempts Spanish translation
  - `REVIEWING_FEEDBACK` - Bot provides AI feedback
  - `MOMENT_SAVED` - Confirmation and return to idle

**States Flow**:
```
/moment â†’ WAITING_FOR_MOMENT â†’ WAITING_FOR_SPANISH â†’ REVIEWING_FEEDBACK â†’ MOMENT_SAVED
```

### 1.3 Basic Moment Data Model
**Goal**: Define how moments are structured and stored

```python
@dataclass
class Moment:
    id: str
    user_id: int
    timestamp: datetime
    english_text: str
    spanish_attempt: str
    ai_correction: str
    ai_explanation: str
    difficulty_score: int  # 1-10
    vocabulary_learned: List[str]
    tags: List[str]
```

### 1.4 Simple Local Storage
**Goal**: Store moments in JSON format initially

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement basic CRUD operations for moments
- [ ] Create user-specific storage (separate files per user)
- [ ] Add backup/export functionality

---

## Phase 2: AI Integration & Feedback (Week 2-3)

### 2.1 AI Service Setup
**Goal**: Integrate with AI API for Spanish corrections and explanations

**Options to Evaluate**:
- OpenAI GPT-4 (most comprehensive)
- Anthropic Claude (good reasoning)
- Google Translate API + GPT for explanations
- Local model with Ollama (privacy-focused)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Choose AI provider based on cost/quality
- [ ] Implement AI service with proper error handling
- [ ] Create prompt templates for different feedback types
- [ ] Add rate limiting and API key management

### 2.2 Intelligent Feedback System
**Goal**: Provide educational and encouraging feedback

**Feedback Components**:
1. **Grammar Corrections**: Highlight specific errors
2. **Alternative Expressions**: Show different ways to say the same thing
3. **Cultural Context**: Explain regional variations or cultural notes
4. **Vocabulary Building**: Suggest related words and phrases
5. **Difficulty Assessment**: Rate the complexity of the user's attempt

**Example Prompt Template**:
```
You are a Spanish tutor. The user wrote this moment in English: "{english_text}"
They attempted this Spanish translation: "{spanish_attempt}"

Please provide:
1. Corrected Spanish version
2. Explanation of 2-3 key errors
3. One alternative way to express the same idea
4. One cultural note if applicable
5. Rate difficulty 1-10

Keep response encouraging and educational.
```

### 2.3 Progressive Difficulty
**Goal**: Adapt feedback complexity to user level

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Track user progress over time
- [ ] Adjust AI prompts based on user level
- [ ] Implement vocabulary difficulty scoring
- [ ] Create beginner/intermediate/advanced feedback modes
